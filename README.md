# Visual-Question-Answering
Visual Question Answering using transfer learning and co-attention models

- How to use the final_model.h5 file for visual question answering?
Use the "VQA_Final_Model_Evaluations_Predictions.ipynb" file. Load the final_model.h5 file to the same folder as the python notebook. Also load the image/images in the same folder. Now you can enter your question/questions and image paths and execute the functions for model prediction/evaluation as needed.

- VQA_EDA.ipynb covers all the Exploratory Data Analysis we have done for this problem statement

- VQA_Modelling.zip file can be downloaded and unzipped to access the VQA_Modelling.ipynb file. This file details the featurizations, model training etc that we have done for a wide range of models including transfer learning models and co-attention model.
